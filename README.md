# Dreame

Control your Dreame robot vacuum with Homey via the Dreame Home cloud API.

> **Have a Matter-compatible Dreame vacuum?** Try [Dreame Matter Cleaner](https://homey.app/nl-be/app/com.dreame.cleaner.pro/Dreame-Matter-Cleaner/) first — it offers local control without cloud dependency. This app is mainly intended for older or non-Matter Dreame vacuums that can only be controlled via the Dreame Home cloud API.

## Usage

1. Install the app from the Homey App Store
2. Add a device and select **Dreame** > **Robot Vacuum**
3. Select your Dreame Home region, enter your email and password, and log in
4. Select your robot vacuum from the list

> **Important:** Only email/password login is supported. Third-party login (Google, Apple, etc.) is not supported.

### Setting up a password in the Dreame Home app

If you signed up using Google, Apple, or another third-party login, you need to set a password first:

1. Open the **Dreame Home** app on your phone
2. Go to **Profile** (bottom right) > **Settings** (gear icon)
3. Tap **Account and Security**
4. Tap **Password** and set a new password
5. Use your email and this password to pair in Homey

> **Tip:** We recommend using a separate Dreame Home account for Homey to avoid potential session conflicts.

## Not Supported

Some features available in the Dreame Home app or in [Tasshack/dreame-vacuum](https://github.com/Tasshack/dreame-vacuum) (Home Assistant) cannot be implemented on Homey due to platform limitations:

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| **Interactive map / room selection** | The dashboard widget shows a rendered map with rooms, but tapping rooms to start cleaning is not possible. Use Flow cards for room cleaning. |
| **Live camera feed** | Homey does not support real-time video streams from devices. |
| **Virtual walls / no-go zones** | Requires interactive map editing — not possible on Homey. Configure these in the Dreame Home app. |
| **Furniture / obstacle detection** | Visual AI detection results require an image/map overlay. |
| **Cleaning history / statistics** | Homey has no UI for historical charts or session logs. Current session data (area, time) is available. |
| **Custom room schedules** | Dreame schedules are managed in the Dreame Home app. Use Homey Flows for time-based automations instead. |
| **OTA firmware updates** | Not relevant for a Homey app. |

> **In short:** Homey excels at automations (Flow cards), device control, and status monitoring. For map-based features, camera, or visual AI, use the Dreame Home app alongside Homey.

## Supported Devices

Should work with any robot vacuum controllable via the [Dreame Home](https://www.dreame.nl/pages/dreame-home) app, including the **X40**, **X30**, **L20**, **L10**, and other models. Currently only tested with the Dreame X40 Ultra.

## Reporting Issues

Found a bug or have a feature request? Please open an [issue](https://github.com/pgrootkop-cmyk/com.dreame.vacuum.cloud/issues) and include:

1. **Your exact vacuum model** (e.g. Dreame X40 Ultra, L20 Ultra, L10 Pro)
2. **A description of the problem** — what happened and what you expected
3. **Diagnostic logs** — run `homey app run --remote` to see real-time logs for debugging

## Roadmap

Features under consideration for future releases:

- **Map rotation** — rotate the map view in settings and widgets.

No timeline or guarantees — these depend on demand and Homey platform capabilities.
