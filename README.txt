Control your Dreame robot vacuum with Homey via the Dreame Home cloud API.

Have a Matter-compatible Dreame vacuum? Try Dreame Matter Cleaner (https://homey.app/nl-be/app/com.dreame.cleaner.pro/Dreame-Matter-Cleaner/) first — it offers local control without cloud dependency. This app is mainly intended for older or non-Matter Dreame vacuums that can only be controlled via the Dreame Home cloud API.

**Usage**
- Install this app on your Homey
- Add a device and select Dreame > Robot Vacuum
- Select your Dreame Home region, enter your email and password, and log in
- Select your robot vacuum from the list

Only email/password login is supported. Third-party login (Google, Apple, etc.) is not supported.

If you signed up using Google, Apple, or another third-party login, you need to set a password first: open the Dreame Home app, go to Profile > Settings > Account and Security > Password, and set a new password. Use your email and this password to pair in Homey.

We recommend using a separate Dreame Home account for Homey to avoid potential session conflicts.

**Setting Up Zones**
1. Open Dreame app settings in Homey
2. Select your device (and floor, if multi-floor)
3. Scroll to the Zones section
4. Enter a zone name (e.g. "Under dining table")
5. Click + Draw, then drag a rectangle on the map
6. Click Save to store the zone
7. Use the "Clean a zone" Flow card to clean saved zones

You can create multiple zones per floor. Delete zones with the X button.

**Flow Tips**
- Cleaning finished: use the "Cleaning finished" trigger card (fires when any cleaning completes and the robot docks)
- Simple room cleaning: "Clean a room" uses whatever settings are active on the vacuum
- Zone cleaning: draw zones in App Settings, then use "Clean a zone" Flow card
- Multi-floor: use "Select floor" card before room or zone cleaning to switch floors

**Not Supported**
Some features from the Dreame Home app or Tasshack/dreame-vacuum (Home Assistant) cannot be implemented on Homey:
- Interactive map / room selection: Dashboard widget shows a rendered map, but tapping rooms to clean is not possible. Use Flow cards.
- Live camera feed: Homey does not support real-time video streams.
- Map editing: Virtual walls and no-go zones must be configured in Dreame Home app. Custom cleaning zones can be drawn in Homey's App Settings.
- Furniture / obstacle detection: Requires image/map overlay.
- Cleaning history / statistics: No historical charts on Homey. Current session data (area, time) is available.
- Custom room schedules: Use Homey Flows for time-based automations instead.

Homey excels at automations (Flow cards), device control, and status monitoring. For map-based features, camera, or visual AI, use the Dreame Home app alongside Homey.
